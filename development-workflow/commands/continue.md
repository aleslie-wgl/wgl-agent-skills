  Protocol (MANDATORY when bugs found):
  1. STOP immediately when bug discovered
  2. Investigate root cause
  3. Fix the bug
  4. Update ALL documentation
  5. Resume testing from where you stopped

  Testing focus: Validate KB system tools and workflows keep Claude on track - the app itself is throwaway.

  Do NOT assume things exist. Test commands with actual bash calls. Cross-reference documentation synchronization."
